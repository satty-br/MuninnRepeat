# MuninnRepeat
MuninnRepeat is a powerful Python-based tool designed to execute HTTP replay attacks, specifically focusing on repetition-based attacks. It allows users to send custom HTTP requests to a target URL, and if the attack contains a payload, it intelligently holds the last byte and sends it to all repetitions simultaneously.
